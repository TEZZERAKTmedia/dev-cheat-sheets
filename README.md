# ðŸ§  Dev Cheatsheets Collection

This repository is a curated collection of fast-access, practical cheat sheets for daily development use. It includes everything from beginner-friendly command references to advanced DevOps workflows, embedded systems tooling, and AR/VR development techniques.

Even the simplest commands are included intentionally â€” to save time, reduce cognitive load during deep-focus work, and act as a reliable daily reference.

## ðŸ’» macOS Kernel Limitation & Linux VM Workaround

Some cheat sheets reference tools that simulate hardware behavior using `socat` and Linux device interfaces like `/dev/ttyS0`. These are **not compatible with macOS**, since Docker on macOS runs inside a lightweight virtual machine without native PTY access or full `/dev` mapping.

To overcome this, the `vm/` section provides a full guide to setting up an **Ubuntu VM via Multipass**. This gives you access to a real Linux kernel and allows Docker and `socat` to simulate serial devices properly â€” ideal for embedded systems development or testing workflows that rely on low-level device access.
